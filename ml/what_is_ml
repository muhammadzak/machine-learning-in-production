Step 1 : Asking the Right Question
Use Machine Learning workflow to process and transform Bank Marketing data to create a prediction model. This model must predict which people are likely to subscribe a term deposit with 70% or greater accuracy.
Step 2: Preparing data
Data Rule 1: Closer the data is to what you are predicting, the better.
Data Rule 2: Data will never be in format you need.
- columns to eliminate - not used, no values, duplicates.
- correlated columns - same information in different format, adds little values.
- Molding Data - adjust data types, create columns if required;
- Dealing with missing data - ignore , impute it;
Data Rule 3: Accurately predicting rare events is difficult;
Data Rule 4: Track how to manipulate data;
